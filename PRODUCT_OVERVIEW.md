# Company Fit Explorer - Product Overview

## **Product Concept**
Company Fit Explorer is an interactive visualization tool that helps professionals discover and evaluate companies that align with their career goals. It uses a Candidate Market Fit (CMF) approach to position companies in a visual graph based on how well they match the user's preferences, requirements, and career aspirations.

## **Core Value Proposition**
Instead of browsing endless company lists or job boards, users get a personalized, visual map of their career opportunities with companies positioned based on actual fit scores and relationships to their professional profile.
